# bd - Binary Dependency Manager

`bd` is a simple tool for managing Go binary dependencies. It allows you to specify the required tools, their versions, and target installation directory in a configuration file (`bd.json`).

## Features
- Ensures consistent versions of binaries across environments.
- Installs binaries to a dedicated directory, preventing pollution of global `GOBIN`.
- Supports custom binary names with version suffixes.
- Avoids dependency conflicts often encountered with `tools.go`.
- Provides an easy way to execute installed binaries with `bd exec`.

## Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository and build manually, or install using go install
 go install github.com/yourusername/bd@latest
```

## Usage

### 1. Define your dependencies in `bd.json`

```json
{
  "binDir": "bin",
  "binaries": [
    { "package": "golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports", "version": "latest", "name": "goimports" },
    { "package": "github.com/mgechev/revive", "version": "v1.3.0", "name": "revive" }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Install binaries
```sh
bd install
```
This will install the specified binaries into `binDir`, appending their versions to the filenames.

### 3. Execute binaries
```sh
bd exec goimports -w main.go
```
If the binary is not found, `bd` will suggest running `bd install` first.

## Why use bd?
- Keeps your projectâ€™s tooling self-contained, avoiding version conflicts.
- Works without modifying `go.mod` or relying on `tools.go`.
- Ensures team-wide consistency in CI/CD and local development.
